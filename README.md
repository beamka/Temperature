Task:
Make an application that displays average temperature for the past hour.
There must be an HTML page that shows only one number.
The number is updated every 5 seconds by making AJAX call to a REST endpoint
The endpoint collects data from a database and returns JSON with single value.
The database contains a table with two columns "timestamp" and "temperature".
The data is randomly generated and stored to the database every 10 seconds.
